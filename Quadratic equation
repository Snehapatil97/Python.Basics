The standard form of Quadratic euation is ax^2 + bx + c =0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not equal to 0.
The Python program to solve a quadratic equation can be given as follows,

import cmath

a=2
b=5
c=7

#calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

#find two  solutions
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solutions are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))

print("The solution for quadratic eqquation is", (sol1,sol2))
